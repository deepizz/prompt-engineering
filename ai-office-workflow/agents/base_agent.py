"""Base class for every agent in this project.

This is the entire "agent framework" -- about 20 lines. An agent is
just a name, a system prompt that defines its persona/role, and a
`run()` method that sends a prompt to the LLM. Subclasses override
`run()` to shape their specific input into a good prompt, but they
all ultimately call `super().run(prompt)` to actually talk to the
model via llm_client.call_llm().
